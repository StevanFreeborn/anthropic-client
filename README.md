# AnthropicClient

> [!NOTE]  
> This client library is heavily inspired by the [Anthropic.SDK](https://github.com/tghamm/Anthropic.SDK) library. I chose to create a new library because I wanted to handle streaming and tool calling differently as well as have control over the client library as I plan to use it to build a connector for [SemanticKernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel).

## ⚠️ Under Construction ⚠️

This is a client library for the Anthropic API. It is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use.
